== Overview

This project represent an alternative method for calculating the easter sunday of a year not utilizing the epact approach as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter.

Here I use a table containing the first full moon of a year, the previous full moon and the next full moon for the 19 golden numbers.

This method was used back in a high school project and I cannot remember anymore where we found this method 30 years ago.

Just for fun now implemented in Kotlin.
